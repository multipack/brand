# The Multipack Brand

## Logo

Since 2010, the Multipack’s logo has featured a simplified rendition of Laurence Broderick’s *The Guardian,* the [bronze bull sculpture that sits outside the Bullring Centre in Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Ring,_Birmingham#Artwork).

A few notes on usage:

* When used in the logo, the word ‘Multipack’ is uppercased
* The bull icon can be used on its own, or with the word mark. When used together, both are aligned to the left.
